# TextGeneration

This Project was initially developed to provide Auto Complete feaure for Schnell Console. Schnell Console used this model for very breif period where it read users bash history to provide suggestions in its autocomplete widget. However, on the basis of UX principles a GUI(mouse based design) has proven to add more value to users rather than Keyboard based UI design.
